📘 Project Overview

1.1 Project Title

Machine Learning-Based Prediction and Optimization of Renewable Energy Production

1.2 Summary of Project Topic and Background

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are essential in meeting global sustainability goals. However, predicting their energy output is challenging due to dependence on dynamic weather conditions. This project aims to build accurate forecasting models using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM.

The dataset used is a combination of energy generation data from ENTSOE, Spanish grid operator Red Electric España, and OpenWeather data, hosted on Kaggle. It contains hourly electricity generation (by source), load, and matching weather data for multiple cities.

The main goal is to preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, and build robust predictive models that can forecast energy demand and supply with high accuracy, supporting better energy management and policy decisions.

1.3 Research Question

How can machine learning techniques be effectively applied to improve forecasting accuracy for renewable energy production using combined energy and weather datasets?

1.4 Project Objectives

📥 Data Collection & Preprocessing: Merge energy and weather datasets; handle missing data, encode timestamps, normalize features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize seasonal patterns, trends, correlations.

🤖 Model Development: Train Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM models.

⚙️ Model Evaluation: Assess with RMSE and R² metrics; analyze residuals.

📈 Visualization: Create various output plots like predictions vs actuals, residual plots, and performance comparisons.

🔐 Data Management: Maintain clean version control on GitHub and backup data securely.

📝 Final Report & Presentation: Compile comprehensive documentation and present insights.
