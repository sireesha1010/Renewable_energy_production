1. Project Overview
1.1 Project Title
Machine Learning-Based Prediction and Optimization of Renewable Energy Production
1.2 Summary of Project Topic and Background
Renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainability. However, predicting energy production from solar, wind, and hydro sources is challenging due to weather variations and seasonal patterns. Traditional forecasting models often fail to capture these complexities, whereas machine learning (ML) approaches offer higher accuracy by identifying patterns in historical data. This project applies ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost to develop predictive models for renewable energy production and optimize distribution. Using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), this study will preprocess energy records by handling missing values, normalization, and trend analysis. Model accuracy will be evaluated using RMSE and R² scores to ensure reliable predictions. This research will provide valuable insights for policymakers and energy providers, aiding in better energy distribution planning. By integrating ML-based forecasting, the project aims to enhance efficiency and reliability in renewable energy integration.
